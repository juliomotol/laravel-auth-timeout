## Why Laravel Auth Timeout?

There are times where we want to log out a user when they haven't done any request within a set time. There is a workaround (below):

```
/* Somewhere in config/session.php */
'lifetime' => 15,
```

But this affects the entirety of the session. But it doesnt have to be and that is where Laravel Auth Timeout comes in.

Laravel Auth Timeout is a small middleware package that checks if the user had made any request in a set of time. If they have reached the idle time limit, they are then logged out on their next request. Thanks to Brian Matovu's [article](http://bmatovu.com/laravel-session-timeout-auto-logout/).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```sh
composer require juliomotol/laravel-auth-timeout
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-auth-timeout-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
<?php

return [

    /**
     * The session name used to identify if the user has reached the timeout time.
     */
    'session' => 'last_activity_time',


    /**
     * The minutes of idle time before the user is logged out.
     */
    'timeout' => 15,

    /**
     * The event that will be dispatched when a user has timed out.
     */
    'event' => JulioMotol\AuthTimeout\Events\AuthTimedOut::class,

];
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

For a simple usage, register the `CheckAuthTimeout` in your `Kernel.php`.

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    ...
    'auth.timeout' => \JulioMotol\AuthTimeout\Middlewares\CheckAuthTimeout::class,
    ...
];
```

Then use that middleware on a route.

```php
Route::get('/admin', [
    'uses' => 'FooBarController@Foobar',
    'middleware' => ['auth.timeout']
]);
```

### Using Different Guards

You might have multiple guards and only want to apply `CheckAuthTimeout` to certain ones. We got you covered, `CheckAuthTimeout` accepts a `$guard` parameter.

```php
Route::get('/admin', [
    'uses' => 'FooBarController@Foobar',
    'middleware' => ['auth.timeout:custom-guard'] // Add the guard name as a parameter for the auth.timeout middleware.
]);
```

> NOTE: This package only works with guards that uses a `session` driver.

### AuthTimedOut

An `AuthTimedOut` will be dispatch every time a user has timed out. You can assign a listener for this event in your `EventServiceProvider`.

```php
protected $listen = [
    \JulioMotol\AuthTimeout\Events\AuthTimedOut::class => [
        // ...
    ],
];
```

`AuthTimedOut` has two properties that you can access in your `EventListener`.

```php
class FooEventListener
{
    public function handle(AuthTimedOut $event)
    {
        $event->user;
        $event->guard;
    }
}
```

### Redirection

To modify the redirection when a user has timed out, you can use `CheckAuthTimeout::setRedirectTo()` within your `AppServiceProvider` to set a redirection callback.

```php
class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        CheckAuthTimeout::setRedirectTo(function ($request, $guard){
            return match($guard){
                'custom-guard' => route('some.route'),
                default => route('auth.login')
            };
        });
    }
}
```

### AuthTimeout Facade

This package also provides a facade with the following methods:

```php
AuthTimeout::init() // Initialize the timeout session when no has been set yet.

AuthTimeout::check($guard) // Check if a user has timed out and logs them out if so.

AuthTimeout::hit() // Reset the user's timeout session.

AuthTimeout::lastActiveAt() // The last activity time of the user.
```
